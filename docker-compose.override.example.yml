# docker-compose.override.yml — DEV MODE
#
# Docker Compose auto-loads this file alongside docker-compose.yml.
# It mounts your source code directly into containers, so you can
# edit code and just restart the container — no rebuild needed.
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose up pv-forecast        # start with live code
#   # edit code...
#   docker compose restart pv-forecast   # pick up changes instantly
#
# This file is in .gitignore — it's your personal dev config.
# To run in "production mode" without this, use:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
#
